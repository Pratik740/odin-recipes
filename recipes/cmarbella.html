        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Marbella is a classic chicken recipe that's easy to make by marinating chicken pieces overnight with sweet prunes, olives, garlic, 
        and red wine vinegar. Baste the chicken with the pan juices as it bakes for amazing flavor. It's a perfect party dish, and keeps and reheats well.
        This dish is delicious and will definitely be on heavy rotation .    </p>
        <p><strong>The best part is that it looks like you spent all day cooking, but is really
        easy to make (don't even have to chop anything).”</strong></p>

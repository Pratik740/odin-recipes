        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If these lemon ricotta pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate! They are easy to make and delicious served with a pat of butter, lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.

        <br>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest (just the yellow part of the skin)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk cold water and baking soda in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, egg, lemon zest, vegetable oil, sugar, and vanilla; whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk in 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour, melted butter, and lemon juice until most of flour disappears into batter. Let batter sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the hot griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        </ol>
